Exploratory Data Analysis on the Kaggle House Price dataset using python- inspired by Krish Naik's tutorial.
# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to understand the dataset, discover patterns, identify key features, handle missing values, and prepare the data for future machine learning models.

This analysis was done as part of my learning journey in machine learning and was **inspired by a tutorial by Krish Naik**. I followed the steps to practice and enhance my data analysis skills, and made modifications along the way.
